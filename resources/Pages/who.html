        <h1>Who I Am</h1>

        <p>I am a family man first. I do whatever it takes to take care of my family. This means providing for them to the best of my abilities. I strive to be the best in my professions in order to move up and give my family what they deserve.</p>

        <p>I am a learner. I continue to learn new things in my professional life as well as private life. Coding provides a great platform for continous learning, because of it's vast amount of information. It also allows for the creativity of trying things that have not been utilized a great amount.</p>
